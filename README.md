# New Content for Magiclysm

This mod just adds a few spells and other things I've written to the Magiclysm mod.

Current additions:

DRUID SPELLS

1) Verdant Form: Turn into a tree-man and blend into the wilderness
2) Whisper of the Leaves: Speak to the forest and gain its wisdom [currently not working, mutations provided by enchantments are bugged]
3) Vegetative Poultice: Who needs modern coagulants when you have bark and leaves? 
4) Nature's Guardian: Summon a bear who actually wants to defend you and slay your enemies.
5) Harvest of the Hunter: Create magical entangling arrows out of natural ingredients
6) Thornskin: A small bit of armor and thorns that damage your attackers (+Enhanced version)
7) Spear of Brambles: Turn a stick into a thorny spear (+Enhanced version that removes spell component)
8) Vengeance of Nature: Enhanced version of Vegetative Grasp, powerful enough to shatter buildings (learned from maxing Vegetative Grasp)

EARTHSHAPER SPELLS

1) Reading the Earthbones: Reveal the world map (at max level, as well as a radio tower)
