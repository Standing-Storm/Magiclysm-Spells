# New spells for magiclysm

This mod just adds a few spells and other things I've written to the Magiclysm mod.

Current additions:

DRUID SPELLS

1) Verdant Form: Turn into a tree-man and blend into the wilderness
2) Whisper of the Leaves: Speak to the forest and gain its wisdom [currently not working, mutations provided by enchantments are bugged]
3) Vegetative Poultice: Who needs modern coagulants when you have bark and leaves? 
4) Nature's Guardian: Summon a bear who actually wants to defend you.
5) Harvest of the Hunter: Create magical slowing arrows out of natural ingredients
6) Thornskin: A small bit of armor and thorns that damage your attackers
